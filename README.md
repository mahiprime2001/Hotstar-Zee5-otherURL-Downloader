# Hotstar-Zee5-otherURL-Downloader
This is a repository that provides videos where users have to provide URL links, and this repository has some limitations. This script does not provide premium accounts; the user must provide their own. I have added browser settings so that the user can use his account and download.

## Installation 
To Install the python Script You must get the python and just run the code, the requirements will **auto-matically download** so no need to do anything just run the code 

## Limitations and Errors 
+ The script only download supported links otherwise it will through the error
+ The script runs on loop if any error occurs then it will stops working 
+ If the output file contents any special character it won't download or the output will not complete
